FootballSimulator:
========================

This is a project which is some kind of a 'training ground' for technologies.

1. http://localhost:8080/FootballSimulator

2. http://localhost:8080/h2console
- jdbc:h2:mem:FootballSimulator
 
3. Under "WEB-INF" folder it is a file named "jboss-deployment-structure.xml"
- without this file you will see only INFO levels (log4j) on the console.
JBoss 7.1.1 requires this file with excluded log4j and slf4j (if used) for log4j/slf4j to work properly
  
4. <f:ajax render=":teamsSelectionForm:display" />
- does work properly if not used in composite components
- does not work if used inside a component, use render="display" instead
